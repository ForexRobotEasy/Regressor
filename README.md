This is the code for the Regressor Forex Software, which is a trading tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team.

## Description

The Regressor Forex Software is designed to calculate and adjust the width of a trading channel in real-time based on market conditions and price movements. The channel width is an important parameter used by traders to identify potential entry and exit points in the market.

The code consists of a single class called 'Regressor' which contains methods to calculate the channel boundaries, set and get the channel width, and test the operability of the software. The main functionality of the software is executed in the `OnStart()` function.

## Usage

To use the Regressor Forex Software, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the Regressor class:

```cpp
Regressor regressor;
```

2. Call the `CalculateChannelBoundaries()` method to calculate and adjust the channel width in real-time:

```cpp
regressor.CalculateChannelBoundaries();
```

3. Get the adjusted channel width using the `GetChannelWidth()` method:

```cpp
double adjustedChannelWidth = regressor.GetChannelWidth();
```

4. Output the adjusted channel width using the `Print()` function:

```cpp
Print('Adjusted channel width: ', adjustedChannelWidth);
```

5. Test the operability of the software using the `TestSoftware()` method:

```cpp
regressor.TestSoftware();
```

## Code Explanation

The code begins by defining the Regressor class, which has a private member variable `channelWidth` to store the current width of the channel. The constructor initializes the `channelWidth` to 0.0.

The `CalculateChannelBoundaries()` method is responsible for calculating the channel boundaries based on market situation and price movements. It also adjusts the channel width based on the magnitude of price deviations and sets the calculated channel width using the `SetChannelWidth()` method.

The `SetChannelWidth()` method is used to set the channel width.

The `GetChannelWidth()` method is used to retrieve the channel width.

The `TestSoftware()` method is used to test the operability of the software. It performs necessary tests and outputs the result using the `Print()` function.

The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `CalculateChannelBoundaries()` method to calculate and adjust the channel width in real-time. It then retrieves the adjusted channel width using the `GetChannelWidth()` method and outputs it using the `Print()` function. Finally, it tests the operability of the software using the `TestSoftware()` method.
